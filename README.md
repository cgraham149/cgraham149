## Hi there 👋  

Hey, I’m Craig. I tinker with self-hosting, automation, and open-source tools—always learning, always building.

As a Digital Strategist, I bridge the gap between IT and Marketing, combining technical expertise with strategic insight. I'm a full-stack developer, GraphDB enthusiast (ArangoDB, Neo4j), and AI tinkerer, always exploring ways to optimize workflows and enhance decision-making.
